Raw videos of this workshop will be available for playback
*immendately* after we cut them (shortly after each break in the
day). You can get the video segments by clicking the little drawer
icon in the upper right corner of the video player:

These raw videos will be available at the link above at least until
the edited versions are published and become available on demand on
[Frontend Masters Courses Page](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/).

As long as you are a paying subscriber, you will have access to this
material.
